# CodeClan Client Experience

Since completing my studies at CodeClan, I have been using my new skills to continue development on an administration application for a local youth club.

The application will track attendance and store inforamtion about the service users. Critical information such as:

- Name, age and address of the service user
- Allergies
- Parent/guardian contact details
- Emergency contact
- GP details

Upon completion, the application will be deployed and used by the youth club to help inform their daily routines. They will be able to use the app to create a list based on eligibility of service user attending an activity.

As the first UX team to take on the project, we quickly identified which direction we want to take, after a reasonable evaluation period. We decided to rearrange the layout of some componants as well as stresmline the colour scheme.
